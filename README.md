# MiniMax

## **Riversi**:

**about**: As a first dive into minimax I think this project was relatively successful, I had an attempt at using Alpha Beta Pruning to speed up calculations but that plan didn't pass the test stages yet. I very recently saw this [project](https://github.com/Ynlay/RiversiPython) by Ynlay, he managed to get Alpha Beta Pruning working with a command line riversi game, congrats ðŸ¥³.

Riversi is a game I have been playing with my family for years, sadly the bot could beat my parents instantly.

There are some downsides, the algorithm is not efficient enough and can look only 4 moves ahead, with fast gameplay, 6 if you want intermediate speed, otherwise it will chug along for ages thinking.

Luckily it is still beatable when only looking two moves ahead ðŸ˜„
